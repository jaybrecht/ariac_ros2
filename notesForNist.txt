Jason Agents:
Our Agents' code are in the folder 'ariac_ros2/human_control', we need everything in there.
It requires Java SDK-17 to be installed.
To execute the agents you must run, at 'ariac_ros2/human_control', one of the three versions:
a) for Indifferent:  ./gradlew runIndif
b) for Antagonistic: ./gradlew runAntag
c) for Helper:       ./gradlew runHelp 

Additional files and configurations required by the agents:

We developed four (4) python ROS nodes, which are in the folder 'ariac_human/launch': 
  launch/human_listener.py
  launch/robot_listener.py
  launch/snapshot.py
  launch/clockNode.py

Should modify the following files:
ariac_gazebo/launch/ariac.launch.py 
ariac_human/CMakeLists.txt 
ariac_human/package.xml added the <exec_depend> clause to allow movebase_server.py to call the teleport service 
ariac_gazebo/models/floor/model.sdf - added <surface> clause 


It was also developed a Gazebo plugin in C++, which involves the following files:
ariac_msgs/srv/TeleportHuman.srv
ariac_msgs/CMakelist.txt
ariac_plugins/include/ariac_plugins/human_teleport_plugin.cpp 
ariac_plugins/src/human_teleport_plugin.cpp 
ariac_plugins/CMakelist.txt
ariac_human/models/human/model.sdf
