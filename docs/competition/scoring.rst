Scoring
========

There are three major components of the Trial Score in ARIAC 2023.

1. `Cost Factor`: How much does the system (sensors) cost?
2. `Efficiency Factor`: How fast or efficiently did the system complete the task(s)
3. `Completion Score`: How well did the task(s) get performed? Are all the correct parts
there in the proper place?

Cost Factor
-----------

The Cost Factor :math:`CF` compares the cost of the sensors chosen by the team to the average of all sensor configurations across all teams.


.. - the original formula:

..   .. math::

..     MI = 171 - 5.2 \ln V - 0.23 G - 16.2 \ln L

.. - the derivative used by SEI:

..   .. math::

..     MI = 171 - 5.2\log_2 V - 0.23 G - 16.2 \log_2 L + 50 \sin(\sqrt{2.4 C})
