# Scoring

There are three major components of the Trial Score in ARIAC 2023.
1. `Cost Factor`: How much does the system (sensors) cost?
2. `Efficiency Factor`: How fast or efficiently did the system complete the task(s)?
3. `Completion Score`: How well did the task(s) get performed? Are all the correct parts in the proper place?

## Cost Factor

The Cost Factor \mathrm{CF} compares the cost of the sensors chosen by the team to the average of all sensor configurations across all teams.
